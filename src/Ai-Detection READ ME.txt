🤖 Human vs AI Text Classifier

This project aims to detect whether a given piece of text is **written by a human** or **generated by an AI**. It uses two powerful transformer-based models — **GPT-2** and **RoBERTa-Large (OpenAI's detector model)** — both fine-tuned for binary classification, and combines them via an ensemble strategy for maximum performance.

🧠 Models Used

1. GPT-2 (Fine-tuned)
- Base model: `gpt2` from HuggingFace
- Fine-tuned on a custom dataset of AI- and human-written texts
- Task: Binary classification (0 = Human, 1 = AI)

2. RoBERTa-Large (OpenAI Detector, Fine-tuned)
- Base model: `roberta-large-openai-detector`
- Originally designed by OpenAI for detecting GPT-generated text
- Fine-tuned on the same binary classification task

⚙️ Ensemble Strategy

To boost classification performance, I used the output logits from both models and trained a **Logistic Regression** model on top of them.

✅ Final Result:
**98.2% accuracy** on the test set using the ensemble model.  
This outperforms both models individually.

📈 Why It Works

- GPT-2 is generative, capturing stylistic nuances of AI text.
- RoBERTa-Large OpenAI Detector is discriminative, highly tuned to AI vs. human features.
- Logistic Regression combines their complementary signals effectively.
